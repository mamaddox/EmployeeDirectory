# EmployeeDirectory

This is a pretty standard Employee Search Directory.\
\
Features include:
- Search Employees using Search Criteria
- Restrict Search to specific column specified by dropdown
	- No dropdown selection means a search through all columns
- Change the number of results shown with Show Results dropdown
- Pagination to select page results you wish to see
- Click on a row to display Employee Info Modal

Random user data is being fetched from a Mockaroo API

Normally I would download the framework files, store them locally and reference them that way in the index.html

The application features a C# backend with a React frontend. I built the solution in Visual Studio.
If you have Visual Studio, you can simply open the solution and set it to run the WebAPI and UI project.
